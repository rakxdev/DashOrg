## 🎯 Feature Prioritization

Features are prioritized based on:

### Priority Formula
```
Score = (User Impact × 3) + (Strategic Value × 2) - (Development Effort × 1.5) + (Technical Debt × 1)
```

### Priority Levels
- **P0 (Critical):** Score > 15 - Must have, in active development
- **P1 (High):** Score 10-15 - Planned for next 2-3 versions
- **P2 (Medium):** Score 5-10 - Under consideration
- **P3 (Low):** Score < 5 - Nice to have, long-term backlog

### Evaluation Criteria

| Criterion | Weight | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| User Impact | 3x | Number of users affected and value provided |
| Strategic Value | 2x | Alignment with vision and enabling future features |
| Development Effort | -1.5x | Complexity and time required (negative impact) |
| Technical Debt | 1x | Improvement to code quality and maintainability |
