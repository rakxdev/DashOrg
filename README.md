## 🔒 Privacy & Security

**Core Privacy Principles:**
- ✅ **100% Client-Side** - All code runs in your browser, nothing sent to servers
- ✅ **Local Storage Only** - Data stored in browser localStorage, never transmitted
- ✅ **No Tracking** - Zero analytics, cookies, or external connections
- ✅ **Open Source** - Fully auditable code, transparent implementation
- ✅ **Optional Encryption** - Master password protection with AES-256 encryption

**Security Best Practices:**
1. Use only on trusted, personal devices
2. Enable master password for sensitive data
3. Regular backups using Export feature
4. Clear data before using shared computers
5. Use strong, unique passwords for each credential

**Data Storage:**
All data stored locally in browser localStorage with optional encryption. Export feature creates JSON backup for portability.
